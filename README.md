# The Sem-Lex Benchmark: Modeling ASL Signs and Their Phonemes
The Sem-Lex Benchmark contains 91,148 isolated sign videos representing a vocabulary of 3,149 American Sign Language signs.
41 deaf participants contributed the videos, which were aligned with [ASL-LEX 2.0](https://asl-lex.org/) and [ASL SignBank](https://aslsignbank.haskins.yale.edu/) by a team of linguists.
The Benchmark may be combined with [ASL Citizen](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/asl-citizen/overview/) for a total of 174k videos.
